## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Integration not appearing in search**
   - Ensure HACS is properly installed
   - Check that the repository was added correctly
   - Restart Home Assistant after installation

2. **Cannot connect to server**
   - Verify the Chatterbox TTS server is running and accessible
   - Check the host and port configuration in the integration
   - Ensure network connectivity between Home Assistant and the TTS server
   - Test server connectivity: `curl http://[SERVER_IP]:[PORT]/health`

3. **TTS not working**
   - Check Home Assistant logs for error messages
   - Verify the server's `/health` endpoint responds: `http://[SERVER_IP]:[PORT]/health`
   - Test the server directly with its web interface (if available)
   - Ensure the server has the required voice models downloaded

### Enabling Debug Logging

Add this to your `configuration.yaml` to enable debug logging:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.chatterbox_tts: debug
```
